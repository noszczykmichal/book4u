## General Information

- The app uses Project Gutenberg's API to provide user with access to PG's database - full documentation of the API can be found [here](https://gnikdroy.pythonanywhere.com/docs/)
- At start the app downloads the list of books available in the database. The user can jump between pages and manually search for something to read or use filters to narrow down the criteria of the books he/she is interested in (e.g user can search for the books of given author, or having certain word in a title).
- When user finds book he/she is interested in, it can be marked as a favorite one.
- The app enables user to read books online.
