## General Information

- The app uses an API built upon Project Gutenberg's database to provide the user with access to the PG database. Full documentation of the API can be found [here](https://gnikdroy.pythonanywhere.com/docs/).
- At start, the app downloads the list of books available in the database. The user can jump between pages and manually search for something to read or use filters to narrow down the criteria of the books he/she is interested in (e.g., the user can search for the books of a given author or with a certain word in the title).
- When the user finds a book he/she is interested in, it can be marked as a favorite.
- The app enables user to read books online.
